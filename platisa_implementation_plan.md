# 📋 Platisa Ultimate Implementation Plan

## 🇷🇸 CORE PRINCIPLE: Serbian Language First

**Platisa is built for Serbian users.** All features MUST support:
1. ✅ **Serbian Latin** (Latinica: Račun, Faktura, Datum)
2. ✅ **Serbian Cyrillic** (Ћирилица: Рачун, Фактура, Датум)
3. ⚪ English (Nice to have, but NOT priority)

**📖 See: [SERBIAN_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md](./SERBIAN_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md) for detailed implementation rules**

**Key Rules:**
- Every OCR/parsing pattern MUST include both Serbian scripts
- Test with real bills in both Latin and Cyrillic
- Never assume one script over the other
- Serbian date format: dd.MM.yyyy
- Serbian number format: 12.345,67 (dot for thousands, comma for decimals)

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build a **production-grade, premium** receipt management system.
**Philosophy**: "Deep Engineering" - Robustness, Security, Performance, and User Experience are paramount. No shortcuts.

### 🚀 Recent Achievements (2025-11-23)

#### 🎨 Cyberpunk UI Redesign
- **Technique**: Implemented a custom "Neon" design system using Jetpack Compose modifiers.
- **Details**:
    - Replaced standard Material Design components with custom-built **NeonCards** featuring glowing borders and glassmorphism backgrounds.
    - Implemented a **Dashboard Layout** for the Home Screen, moving away from a simple list view.
    - Created a **"Total Spending" Neon Bar** with gradient borders and glow effects for high visual impact.
    - Applied **Color-Coded Status Indicators** (Orange/Yellow/Green) to receipt cards to visually represent payment status (Unpaid/Processing/Paid).
    - **Optimization**: Used `DrawModifier` for efficient rendering of glow effects without heavy bitmap shadows.

#### 🔄 Smart Sync Optimization
- **Technique**: Hybrid scheduling using Android `WorkManager`.
- **Details**:
    - **Immediate Sync**: Configured a `OneTimeWorkRequest` to trigger instantly upon application startup, ensuring fresh data is always available.
    - **Daily Background Sync**: Implemented a `PeriodicWorkRequest` scheduled specifically for **14:00 (Serbian Time)**. This timing was chosen to align with typical bill delivery windows while minimizing battery impact.
    - **Efficiency**: The system intelligently calculates the initial delay to hit the 14:00 window precisely, regardless of when the app was last opened.

#### 📄 Advanced PDF & QR Handling
- **Technique**: Native PDF Rendering + Image Binarization.
- **Details**:
    - Solved the issue of blank PDF previews by switching from third-party libraries to Android's native `PdfRenderer`.
    - Implemented a custom **Binarization Filter** (Thresholding) to convert grayscale PDF renders into pure Black & White bitmaps. This significantly improved QR code detection rates for EPS bills.
    - **Hybrid Scanning**: The system now attempts to scan the raw image first, and falls back to the binarized high-contrast version if the initial scan fails.

### 🎯 Latest Refinements (2025-12-23)

#### 📊 Advanced Statistics & Visual Enhancements
- **Spending Trends Graph Overhaul**:
  - **Dynamic Y-Axis**: Implemented a smart 5-line scaling system (2k, 5k, 10k steps) ensuring optimal data visualization regardless of spending range.
  - **'k' Formatting**: Clean integer display (e.g., "10k" vs "10000") for better readability.
  - **Visual Polish**: Added "Glass/3D/Polished Metal" effects to graph bars using complex gradients, edge lighting, and metallic shine overlays.
- **Tariff Usage Visualization**:
  - Added specific circular progress cards for **Niža Tarifa** (Low Tariff) and **Viša Tarifa** (High Tariff).
  - Integrated real consumption data from `EpsData` entity, correctly filtered by receipt dates.
  - Consistent Neon aesthetics (Neon Cyan / Neon Magenta).

#### 🔄 Sync Robustness & User Experience
- **Duplicate Handling Strategy**:
  - **Problem**: Duplicate bills (same invoice number) were triggering "Error" notifications during sync.
  - **Solution**: Refined `SyncReceiptsUseCase` to identify and silently skip duplicates without flagging them as errors.
  - **Result**: "Greška: Duplikat" messages removed; Sync status now correctly reflects "Success" even if bills were skipped.
- **Graph Visibility Fix**:
  - Fixed an issue where tariff graphs were empty due to missing dates in `EpsData`.
  - Implemented a repository-level join to fetch dates from the parent `Receipt` entity.

### 🎯 Latest Refinements (2025-12-20)

#### 📸 Camera Zoom Fix for QR Scanning
- **Problem**: Camera couldn't scan QR codes from receipts - image too zoomed out

### 🎯 Latest Refinements (2025-12-17)

#### 🔒 CRITICAL FIX: Serbian Cyrillic Invoice Number Support
- **Problem**: Duplicate bill detection was failing, causing:
  1. Missing bills - All bills hidden because marked as "duplicates" when they weren't
  2. False duplicates - Different bills marked as same because parser extracted wrong 8-digit codes
  3. Cyrillic bills ignored - Parser only looked for Latin "Račun broj", missed Cyrillic "Рачун број"
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - ❌ Missing Cyrillic patterns - No support for Рачун број, Број рачуна, Позив на број
  - ❌ 8-digit minimum too short - Extracted company registration codes instead of invoice numbers
  - ❌ Aggressive blocking - No way to override when duplicate detected
- **Solution Implemented** (`ReceiptParser.kt`):
  - ✅ **Full Cyrillic Support**: Added ALL Serbian Cyrillic patterns
    - Рачун број / Број рачуна (Invoice number)
    - Фактура / Број фактуре (Invoice/bill)
    - Позив на број (Reference number - common on utilities)
    - Број документа (Document number)
    - Рач. бр / Бр. рачуна / Факт. бр (Abbreviated forms)
  - ✅ **Stricter Length**: Changed minimum from 8 → 10 digits to avoid false positives
  - ✅ **Better Logging**: Shows extracted number + which pattern matched
  - ⚠️ **Temporary Disable**: Duplicate prevention disabled during testing phase
- **Testing Phase** (2025-12-17):
  - Duplicate check temporarily disabled to verify invoice extraction works
  - Added comprehensive logging to track: extraction → save → display flow
  - Will re-enable with smarter logic after confirming all bills save/display correctly
- **Expected Re-enablement Logic**:
  ```kotlin
  // Future smart duplicate handling
  if (invoiceNumber matches && length >= 10) {
    // Show warning dialog
    // "This invoice already exists. Save anyway?"
    // [Cancel] [Save Anyway]
  }
  ```
- **Result**: 
  - ✅ Serbian Cyrillic bills now detected correctly
  - ✅ False positive duplicates eliminated
  - ✅ All bills save and display properly
  - 🔧 Smarter duplicate prevention coming after testing
- **See**: `SERBIAN_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md` - Now the reference for all text scanning features

  - Smooth animated scroll to bill position in list

#### 🎮 UI Navigation & Interaction Improvements  
- **Help Icon Added**: New green help icon in header next to notifications and theme toggle
  - Placeholder for future help/guide implementation
  - Matches glassmorphic style of other header icons
  - Uses `Icons.Default.Help` with neon green accent color
- **Fixed Bill Card Click Issues**: 
  - **Root Cause**: Snap-to-top scroll behavior was consuming touch events on bottom bills
  - **Solution**: Completely disabled snap-to-top feature to eliminate interference
  - Single tap now works reliably on all bills (top, middle, bottom)
  - Normal scrolling still works perfectly
- **"Confirm Payment" Button**: Added to PROCESSING status bills
  - Green button with check icon appears on purple/magenta bills  
  - Button text: "POTVRDI PLAĆANJE" (16sp font, bold)

    - **Generic patterns**: ID numbers, long numbers after keywords, standalone 12+ digit numbers
    - Minimum 8 digits (down from 10) to catch more bill formats
  - **Database Schema** (`ReceiptEntity.kt`):
    - Added `invoiceNumber` field with UNIQUE INDEX constraint
    - Database automatically rejects duplicate invoice numbers
    - Version bumped to 5 (will trigger reset due to `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`)
  - **Deduplication Logic** (`SyncReceiptsUseCase.kt`):
    - Checks `getReceiptByInvoiceNumber()` before inserting
    - If duplicate found → Skip with log message
    - Also catches `SQLiteConstraintException` as backup safety
  - **Repository Layer**:
    - Added `getReceiptByInvoiceNumber()` method to DAO, Repository interface, and implementation
    - Proper query: `SELECT * FROM receipts WHERE invoiceNumber = :invoiceNumber LIMIT 1`
  - **UI Display** (`BillDetailsScreen.kt`):
    - Shows invoice number as "BROJ RAČUNA" field
    - Positioned between Amount and Due Date
    - Only displays when invoice number was successfully extracted
    - Uses Tag icon in neon cyan color
- **Works For All Bill Types**:
  - ⚡ Electricity (EPS) - "Račun broj: 100014550316"
